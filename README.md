# Tiny web app to calculate rates/price for car sharing

A price calculator for a car sharing club I am a member of. The previous calculator was written in Visual Basic and had reached end of life. This is my first attempt to use backbonejs.

Hopefully this is a more portable/maintainable solution for such a simple application.
